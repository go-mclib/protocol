# CLAUDE.md

- comments that are not part of symbol or package docstrings should start with lowercase letter, unless naming an exported symbol;
- comments should be minimal;
- comments should only document parts of the code that are less obvious;
- keep the API minimal, do not keep legacy code - let user know after making a breaking change, though;
- assume modern Go 1.25+ API, do not use older APIs;

Optionally, see also [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
